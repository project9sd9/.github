## Product Description

The **Ring of Elysium aimbot** is a hack that automatically locks your aim onto enemy players. You set the preferences (headshots, body shots, or both), and the script does the rest. Whether you want legit-looking aim assist or full-blown rage bot snaps, it’s fully customizable.

## Features 🚀

* **Auto-Lock Headshots** – Instantly snap onto enemies for perfect kills.
* **Custom FOV & Smoothness** – Adjust how natural or snappy your aim looks.
